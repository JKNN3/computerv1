A simple program that solves a polynomial second or lower degree equation

In the quadratic expression  *ax^2+bx+c* , each part is called a term.
- *ax^2* is the **quadratic term** (where *a* is the **quadratic coefficient**)
- *bx* is the **linear term** (where *b* is the **linear coefficient**)
- *c* is the **constant term**
