# computerv1
A simple program that solves a polynomial second or lower degree equation

## Usage
    git clone "..." ; cd computerzv
    cargo run [your equation]


-> every entity of the equation need to be formatted like **n * X^y** like

-  ` " 5 * X^0 + 4 * X^1 - 9.3 * X^2 = 1 * X^0 " ` 

## Solving a Second Degree Equation

A quadratic equation is given in the form:

    ax^2 + bx + c = 0

where:
- a ≠ 0 (if a = 0, it is not a quadratic equation),
- b and c are coefficients.

### 1. Calculating the Discriminant

The discriminant is calculated as:

    Δ = b^2 - 4ac

- If Δ > 0, there are two distinct real solutions.
- If Δ = 0, there is one real solution (a double root).
- If Δ < 0, there are two complex conjugate solutions.

### 2. Formula for the Solutions

The solutions of the quadratic equation are given by:

    x₁, x₂ = (-b ± √Δ) / (2a)

- If Δ > 0: The two solutions are real and distinct:
    
    `x₁ = (-b + √Δ) / (2a)` ` x₂ = (-b - √Δ) / (2a)`
- If Δ = 0: The solution is real and repeated:

    `x = -b / (2a)`
- If Δ < 0: The solutions are complex:
    
    `x₁ = (-b + i√|Δ|) / (2a)` `x₂ = (-b - i√|Δ|) / (2a)`

## Special Cases in Solving Equations

### Special Case 1: Infinite Solutions

An equation can have infinitely many solutions when the equality holds true for any value of the variable.

#### Example:


    4x + 1 + x = 3 + 5x - 2


Simplify both sides:


    4x + x - 5x = 3 - 2 - 1
    0 = 0


The resulting equality, ` 0 = 0 `, is always true regardless of the value of \( x \).  
Thus, the equation has **infinitely many solutions**.

---

### Special Case 2: No Solution

An equation may have no solution when the equality is false for any value of the variable.

#### Example:


    3x + 2 = 2x + 5 + x


Simplify both sides:


    3x - 2x - x = 5 - 2

    0 = 3


The resulting equality, ` 0 = 3 ` , is false.  
Thus, the equation has **no solution**.
